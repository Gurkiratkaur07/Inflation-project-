### Inflation Impact Calculator

This Python project calculates and visualizes the future price of an item based on an annual inflation rate provided by the user. 
It uses **pandas** and **Matplotlib** to handle data and create a clear visualization of how inflation affects prices over time.

#### **Key Features:**
- **User Input**: Takes the current price, expected annual inflation rate, and number of years as inputs.
- **Data Calculation**: Uses a formula to project future prices over the specified period.
- **Data Visualization**: Displays the calculated data in a table and generates a line chart to show the trend of price changes over the years.

This project demonstrates how to handle user input, perform calculations, and create visual representations using Python.
